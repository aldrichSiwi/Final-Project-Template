OCEAN 215 Final Project  
Autumn 2024  

Does phytoplankton populations and chlorophyll concentrations fluctuate seasonally and geographically affects ocean color? 
The goal of this project is to see whether season, geographical, phytoplankton blooms, and chlorophyll concentration affects ocean color or not. The results are they do with comparing the chlorophyll concentration during winter and summer, there is a difference where in Summer is high and in Winter they were low. Geographically it also shows that places in the equator line or that has two seasons doesn't change the ocean color that much.
